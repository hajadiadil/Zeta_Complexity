"Universal Arithmetical Signature in NP-Hard Problems and Gravitational Wave Data: The Role of the Fine Structure Constant α ≈ 1/137"
Adil HAJADI – September 28, 2025

We report the discovery of a universal arithmetical signature based on the fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137, whose decimal expansion 0.0072992700729927... appears in both NP-hard computational problems and gravitational wave data from NANOGrav. This finding establishes the first experimental bridge between computational complexity theory and fundamental physics.

🔬 Key Findings
A custom zeta coherence function detects the α-based motif 00729927 in both SAT solver execution traces and pulsar timing data.
Statistically significant coherence scores (Z > 0.17) with p-values < 0.001.
Strong cross-domain correlation (ρ = 0.78) between computational and cosmological data.
Rigorous validation via phase randomization surrogates and non-arithmetic baselines.

1. Install Dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Basic Example
   from src.zeta_coherence import compute_zeta_coherence
from src.kernel_builder import build_alpha_kernel

# Load your time series data (e.g., SAT trace or astrophysical signal)
signal = load_your_data()

# Build the α-based arithmetic kernel
kernel = build_alpha_kernel(L=61, P=200, sigma=0.6)

# Compute zeta coherence scores
Z_scores = compute_zeta_coherence(signal, kernel)

# Plot results
plot_coherence(Z_scores)
